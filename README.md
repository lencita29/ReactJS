### React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. During my internship, I learned the following concepts related to React:

#### React Components
React components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be nested, managed, and handled independently.

#### Props
Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another. They are read-only and help in making components reusable.

#### State
State is a built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

#### Lifecycle Methods
Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that are called at different stages of a component's lifecycle, such as when the component is mounted, updated, or unmounted.

#### Hooks
Hooks are a new addition in React that allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

- **useState:** A hook that allows you to add state to functional components.
  **useEffect:** A hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
